# Microsoft Azure Container Networking

## Overview
This repository contains container networking plugins for Linux and Windows containers running on Azure:

* [libnetwork (CNM) network and IPAM plugins](docs/cnm.md) for Docker Engine.
* [CNI network and IPAM plugins](docs/cni.md) for Kubernetes and DC/OS.

The `azure-vnet` network plugins connect containers to your [Azure VNET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview), to take advantage of Azure SDN capabilities. The `azure-vnet-ipam` IPAM plugins provide address management functionality for container IP addresses allocated from Azure VNET address space.

> Azure VNET plugins are currently available as a **public preview**.

The following environments are supported:
* [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com): Available in all Azure regions.
* [Microsoft Azure Stack](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/azure-stack/): The hybrid cloud platform that enables you to deliver Azure services from your own datacenter.

Plugins are offered as part of [Azure Container Service (ACS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-service), as well as for individual Azure IaaS VMs. For ACS clusters created by [acs-engine](https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine), the deployment and configuration of both plugins on both Linux and Windows nodes is automatic.
